						 <p> Hi! I’m Julia, a Vermont native, living and working in New York City. Not too long ago, I took a hiatus from college and spent 3 months as a contestant on the reality TV series, Survivor. Since then, I’ve traveled to over 50 countries and knocked some big adventures off my bucket list. 

						Since my first solo journey abroad to Tanzania in 2013, I believe travel is the best education - and the quickest way to enable empowerment. </p>

          				 <P> Click around to learn more about my person journey and access my plethora of travel tips.

						<p>How to Travel Southeast Asia<p>
						<p> Only in the past sixty years has “Southeast Asia” been used to refer to the region comprising modern-day Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, and the Philippines. These ten countries cover an area more than three times that of Great Britain, France, and Germany combined, and they have a population about twice as great.

						These countries have similar warm, wet climates, and they share many trees, flowers, and crops. But their hilly uplands are quite different from their lush river valleys. Also, of course, life in the islands—dominated as it is by the surrounding sea—is different from life on the mainland.Culturally, the region is extremely diverse.Its peoples speak many unrelated languages employing a number of alphabets.</p>

							<p>Napa Valley’s very first RoséFest</p>
							<p>Sterling Winery will host its first (and theoretically annual) RoséFest on Saturday, June 24.
							“We know that Napa is foremost renowned for its cabernet,” Michelle Flores, associate brand manager for Sterling Winery, told Travel + Leisure. “We wanted to put the spotlight on rosé.”
							Dozens of wineries from all around the Napa Valley (and one from Provence) will be pouring out glasses of their pink wine at the event.
							“What’s amazing is that pink wines used to be just sweet white zinfandel,” </p>
							<p>Flores said. “Now it’s much more diverse than that.”
							When visitors arrive at the winery, they will take an aerial tram (the only one at a vineyard) up to the top of Sterling’s hill for wine pourings and panoramic views of the valley.
							About 25 different wineries will pour their rosés for guests to sample. Local restaurants will be serving up bites to accompany the wine. Attendees will be the first in the world to taste Sterling’s brand new sparkling rosé.
							The event will also feature live music, food trucks and opportunities to take in the views of the Napa Valley.
							General admission is $65 and VIP tickets are $85. Proceeds from the event will benefit the Susan G. Komen foundation to fund breast cancer education, research and patient support.</p>
