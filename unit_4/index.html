           <p> Hi! I’m Julia, a Vermont native, living and working in New York City. Not too long ago, I took a hiatus from college and spent 3 months as a contestant on the reality TV series, Survivor. Since then, I’ve traveled to over 50 countries and knocked some big adventures off my bucket list. 

			Since my first solo journey abroad to Tanzania in 2013, I believe travel is the best education - and the quickest way to enable empowerment. </p>

           <P> Click around to learn more about my person journey and access my plethora of travel tips. 
			All information on this website is exclusively based on my own experiences and research. Prices, opening hours, etc. are updated regularly.  </P>
